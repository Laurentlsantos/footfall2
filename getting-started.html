<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Mobile location data provides valuable insights for many different areas as retail, urban planning, real estate and marketing. Location from geolocated data provides a better understanding of both physical and human geography. It enables public and private sectors to monitor footfall, the behaviour and profile of visitors in geographic areas as a local authority boundary, a shopping centre, a retail park, a leisure area or a civic facility.</p>
<p>The digital representations of human movement over time enable to assess and deliver changes based on the understanding of how and when visitors interact with specific locations. For example, to predict how consumers will respond to new locations, retailers need to analyse and track footfall and visitor’ s profile in shopping sectors.</p>
<p>Fine-grained mobility patterns from geolocated data can be applied to study stores, restaurants, shopping centres, parks, urban areas. Indoor or outdoor locations can be tracked and analyzed with mobile phone sensors. Here are some examples of different problems that carry critical geolocation compoments.</p>
<ul>
<li>Retail
<ul>
<li>assess the potential of retail environments to find new locations to stores and restaurants</li>
<li>explain different levels of in-store sales</li>
<li>decide to expand or rationalise points of distribution for online shopping companies</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Real estate
<ul>
<li>study the provision of new residential and commercial units</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Urban design
<ul>
<li>project town planning repurpose projects to repopulate the heart of a town centre and attract a greater proportion of the community</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Transportation
<ul>
<li>study of new transport infrastructures and evaluation of their impacts on footfall and number of visits</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to our smartphone dominated society, anonymised mobility information stemming from cellular infrastructure permits to have access of detailed knowledge about people, things, and events.</p>
<p>With the help of sensors and online networks, <em>human mobility</em> studies can be applied on many different situations and permits to have access of detailed knowledge about people and locations. Human mobility is the underlying social dynamics of population and is key to understand the intersection between location and human movements.</p>
<p><em>Human mobility analytics</em> refers to quantifying and studying people’ s movements. It allows ways to understand not only the “where” but the “how” behind human mobility behaviour is provides an analytical framework for operational or strategic decisions. A range of metrics con be measured, as for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many people visit a shopping centre</li>
<li>How frequently repeat visitors visit a store</li>
<li>The average time visitors spend in a shopping centre</li>
<li>Where do visitors come from</li>
<li>What is the visit frequency of visitors</li>
<li>What is the profile of visitors by age</li>
<li>What are the most visited places in a shopping centre or a street segment</li>
</ul>
<p>To understand these metrics, we rely on big datasets that catch the physical environment of people within a catchment area. In this book, we apply data provided by a major bigdata service in the United Kingdom, <em>Visitor Insights</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="location-technologies" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Location Technologies</h2>
<p>With the help of sensors and online networks, human movements can be tracked in urban and regional scales. Consumer-grade mobile phone sensors<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> are ubiquitous and by processing their outputs, we can determine information about the environment and our relationship to it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our location within the environment</li>
<li>Our motion with respect to the environment</li>
<li>The identity of surrounding objects</li>
<li>When certain events happen</li>
</ul>
<p>Different technologies for tracking human movements are available. Traditionally, footfall counting systems were limited to <em>ultrasonic sensors</em>, <em>Wi-Fi tracking</em>, <em>infrared sensors CCTV</em> and <em>thermal cameras</em>. Each of these methods has limitations, creating concern regarding accuracy and the privacy of people who are moving in space.</p>
<p>A smartphone location-based and tracking service works anywhere a phone signal is receivable . The technology determines the position of a user within a second and is accurate of a few meters. Three main technologies are available:</p>

<p>The first method is the most common type of <em>Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)</em> and consists of tracking the footsteps of people through the pings of their smartphones while searching for a Wi-Fi network (a procedure known as Wi-Fi scan). It uses a model to estimate the range to each <em>Access Point (AP)</em> from the corresponding smartphones.</p>
<p>APs are usually situated in indoor environments such as stores, cafés and airports and need at least three APs for a unique position fix in two dimensions. The direct-path signal is often attenuated by walls and windows, which can reduce the signal range to a few tens of meters. The technology uses signals of opportunity, designed for purposes other than positioning, and is best fit for indoor and small areas with positioning accuracy within about 10m indoors. The method is not designed for large areas as centre towns and outdoor environments.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The second technique, the <em>GPS positioning</em> operates with radio frequency (RF) and a mobile network.</p>
<p>GPS positioning is a self-positioning solution (the position is calculated by an application installed in the mobile device) and uses radio signals transmitted by orbiting satellites. The mobile phone calculates the position using the downlink received from orbiting satellites, the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) constellations.</p>
<p>The positioning solution is calculated with a range-based positioning algorithm<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. Accuracy can be jeopardised by challenging environments. Signals may be blocked by buildings and mountainous terrain. They may also be received via reflected paths, known as non-line-of-sight (NLOS) reception.</p>
<p>In urban areas (including indoors), GPS accuracy can be degraded and other technologies may perform better.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The <em>cell identification</em> positioning is the most current method of location database of mobile phone network companies. The VI Databased relies on this technology.</p>
<p>Cells are essentially geographic radio frequency (RF) signal serving zones around a tower or base station.
Each cell within a cellular network is geographically defined by the range that signals propagate to continuous
space.</p>
<p>When a mobile phone user is moving and enters a serving cell, network base stations are designed to
recognise that the user is within the serving proximity of the station’s neighbourhood. The base station then
automatically ‘locks on’ to the mobile, and ‘hands off’ the call from one base station and corresponding cell to the
next base station and serving cell within the network.</p>
<p>It reports that the user is somewhere within the coverage area of the serving base station. The accuracy of proximity positioning the accuracy of the locational information depends upon the physical architecture of the network and can be enhanced by using multiple transmitters or pattern matching. It is the most recommended technology for large urban and indoor areas with position accurate to a few meters</p>

<div id="vi-data-infrastructure" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> VI Data Infrastructure</h2>
<p>In broad terms, <strong>Visitor Insights</strong> can be viewed as a social and geographic dababase. <em>Social</em> because it informs people characteristics as for example age, occupation and time behaviour and <em>geographic</em> because it hold a location component generated in many different metrics such as the number of visitors within a specific area polygon (i.e. a catchment area or cluster), the change in visitor’s levels in different areas and periods and the number of visits in indoor locations as stores.</p>
<p>The environment in which visitor’s movements are compiled is essential urban. A person can be in motion in a vehicle, running or walking on an open air environment, having a social meeting in a pub or shopping in an indoor environment.
By means of algorithms and artificial intelligence, movement data are aggregate and made available over an on-line platform.</p>
<p>The location integration technology provides an adequate accuracy making the best use of a mass-produced sensors appliance provided in smartphones and radio signals. The movement of people is calculated considering the behaviour of the user (i.e. on a stationary mode or in motion) and the environment such as indoor and outdoor areas.</p>
<p>Visitor Insights web platform allows users to browse through extensive collections of data and related materials, evaluating their potential fitness for use. It provides a platform to search through catalogs of locations, examine the contents and quality of data.</p>
<p>The user is allowed to browse a catalog of entries and query a geofenced catchment area of interest and assess their contents.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="getting-started.html#fig:chunk-VI">1.3</a> provides a view of the principal page of the platform. The main metrics can be exported from this page.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Privacy-compliant data collection and use</h2>
<p>Data collected through sensors is extremely valuable for marketing applications, but privacy concerns are increasingly at the centre of the public debate. .</p>
<p>Even if the identity of the users is not revealed, information of location can somehow lead to infer information about the profile of the users and then be linked to personal identity. Also, linking the data set with other sources might lead to de-anonymise the data, revealing for example the identity of people or information about them (for example their locations).</p>
<p>VI dataset collected through sensors is adhering to stringent privacy protocols and protecting people’ s privacy. No personally identifiable information such as an individual’ s details is available at any point. The data of individuals are aggregated and presented together as a statistical sample meaning that it is not possible to de-anonymise the data<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>All data are fully compliant to the <em>Data Protection Act 2018</em> for the United Kingdom, ensuring that people have control over their personal data.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Representing and Working with Data</h2>
<p>In this book, We will demonstrate how to work with social and geographic datasets from Visitor Insights. To run the exercices, we will use files freely provided and structured for the book. The data refer to a fictional location, the <em>Training Shopping Centre</em>, which will serve as a baseline for the exercises.</p>
<p><strong>R</strong> provides a great interactive environment for doing data science. Many packages for geographic visualisation are designed for R, which allows flexibility and support in programming.
That does not mean that you cannot use other languages. <strong>Python</strong> is also a great language and could also be used to run the same examples presented in this tutorial.</p>
<p>For the exercises, we will be applying a data-driven approach by making a list of data components and then transforming them into graphics. The book follows a data pipeline based on three different stages.</p>
<p>The first step is to import the dataset into R (the commonly used program is R Studio) and then create a data frame. Before exploring the data, some kind of data manipulation may be required, usually referred as <em>data tidying</em>. This means storing it in a consistent form that matches the semantics of the dataset with the way it is stored.</p>
<p>Once the dataset is stored in a consistent format, it is good practice to examine its structure and characteristics. Initial examination of the data is done by summarizing the variables and examine its distribution (for example, find out the mean, maximum and minimum values),</p>
<p>Some kind of data transformation may also be necessary. This usually means to narrow down the dataset as selecting the years for a graph, or aggregating the data for a special purpose (for instance, aggregating and classifying the visits by time period). This is usually done by creating new variables (or objects) that will be necessary when moving to visualisation.</p>
<p>Together, tidying and transforming are called <em>data wrangling</em>. This initial examination provides useful information of variables and a framework to tackle the next stages.</p>
<p>Finally, we can work on visualisation by means of graphs and maps. <em>Data visualisation</em> is the main way to communicate the underlying structure of the data, and look for patterns, trends and correlations.</p>
<p>For data visualisation, we will use the package <strong>ggplot2</strong> (for further references of data visualisation with ggplot2, see <span class="citation">Villanueva (<a href="#ref-R-Villanueva" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>), a powerful tool for producing data graphics and maps by means of a common structure, the <em>grammar of graphics</em>, <span class="citation">Wickham (<a href="#ref-R-Wilkinson" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>. The grammar allows you to compose graphs by combining independent components. Rather than being limited to sets of pre-defined graphics, you can work and create components that are tailored to your specific problem.</p>
<p>You can learn how to install R in the section <em>Appendix</em> and start your journey.</p>
